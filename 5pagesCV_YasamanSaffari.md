**********************
I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at [Kashan University](https://kashanu.ac.ir/en), under the guidance of [Dr. Salimi](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=7ZCf1C8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). My research focuses on **Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems** using **Reinforcement Learning**, with a specific interest in developing **graph-based** and **attention-based** methods for **structural and topological state representation**. I am currently working on a **Medical Dialogue System** that integrates **Large Language Models** with **Adapter-based fine-tuning** and **Reinforcement Learning** to dynamically select medical sub-task behaviors such as diagnosis, inquiry, and recommendation. Another active project involves designing **GMM-based probabilistic topological state representations** for RL environments by leveraging graph learning to handle uncertainty and continuous topology. I have published one **national paper**, one **ISI paper (Engineering Applications of AI, Impact Factor 8) has been accepted**, and another is currently **under review after submitting a revised manuscript (Knowledge-Based Systems, Impact Factor 7.6)**. I plan to **defend my Ph.D. thesis by the end of this summer**.

I hold a Master‚Äôs degree in **Intelligent Simulator Design** from Tabriz Islamic Art University, where my thesis focused on phonological modeling in dubbing through **Voice Cloning** using Deep Neural Networks. During my master‚Äôs, I also developed a **VR-based dance teaching application** using HTC VIVE and Neuron Mocap systems. I have practical experience with VR equipment and motion capture technologies, and I have taught music production using FL Studio.

As my current Ph.D. journey is nearing completion, I am now seeking to expand my research into a broader, globally collaborative environment. While my first Ph.D. has focused on task-oriented dialogue systems and specialized RL-based architectures, I believe that joining a program like Meta FAIR would allow me to transition from applied projects to **fundamental AI research**, contributing to the development of Large Language Models, reinforcement learning, and graph-based reasoning at scale. Enrolling in a new Ph.D. program under joint academic and industry supervision is not a repetition for me, but rather a strategic step to move from a local research context to an international, open-science framework where I can further sharpen my research skills and actively collaborate with top researchers in the field. I am particularly motivated to work in settings where open-source contributions and fundamental AI advancements go hand-in-hand.
