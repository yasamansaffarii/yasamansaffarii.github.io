## About Me

A PhD candidate at [Kashan University](https://kashanu.ac.ir/en) specializing in Reinforcement Learning for Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems. State representation is enriched through graph-based and probabilistic (GMM) methods to capture topological properties of RL environments. Research interests include LLM orchestration, adapter-based fine-tuning, and structural attention. Has developed and deployed medical dialogue agents integrating dynamic policy switching. Publications accepted in Q1 journals (e.g., EAAI, KBS).
