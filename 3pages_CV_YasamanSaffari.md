## About Me

Ph.D. candidate in Artificial Intelligence at [Kashan University](https://kashanu.ac.ir/en), supervised by [Dr. Salimi](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=7ZCf1C8AAAAJ). My research focuses on Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems, combining Reinforcement Learning with Graph-based and Attention-based State Representation Learning. I’m currently developing a Medical Dialogue System using LLMs and Adapter-based Reinforcement Learning for sub-task specialization, alongside a project on GMM-based Probabilistic Topological State Representation. I hold a Master’s degree in Intelligent Simulator Design from Tabriz Islamic Art University, where I worked on Voice Cloning for dubbing. I have practical experience in VR/Motion Capture systems and collaborative AI projects, and I expect to defend my Ph.D. by the end of this summer.
